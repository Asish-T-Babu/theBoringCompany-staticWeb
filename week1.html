        <h1>WHY TUNNELS?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="body12">
        <p>
            To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D, which means either flying cars or tunnels are needed. Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight, and won't fall on your head.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Tunnels minimize usage of valuable surface land and do not conflict with existing transportation systems. A large network of tunnels can alleviate congestion in any city; no matter how large a city grows, more levels of tunnels can be added.

        <div class="body22">
            <p>
                Loop is an all-electric, zero-emissions, underground public transportation system in which passengers are transported directly to their final destination with no stops along the way
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Located at the Las Vegas Convention Center, LVCC Loop is the first commercially operating Loop system.

        <p>
            Prufrock is designed to construct mega-infrastructure projects in a matter of weeks instead of years
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Prufrock is designed to tunnel at a speed of 1 mile per week, which is 6 times faster than The Boring Companyâ€™s previous generation TBM (Godot-Plus). This is still 4-5 times slower than a garden snail...but Prufrock is catching up!
